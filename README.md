# Orpheus Manager
**Making the most horrible things on Earth and beyond a bit easier.**

The Orpheus Manager is a character creation and management tool for The Orpheus Protocol RPG System. The manager is feature complete as of v2.1.2 of The Orpheus Protocol official rules. The character sheet itself does all the stat calculation for you during character creation, and will alert you if you are missing anything important. During gameplay, the manager gives you a streamlined interface to track resources, reference rules, and take notes. You can save your character sheet between sessions, and the file format is designed to be compatible with other community developed tools for The Orpheus Protocol.
